# Overview
At Wood Castle Studio, we are doing the best we can to give back to the Cardano community by releasing our source code to help other developers and new CNFT project hit the ground running when working with NFTMakerProd APIs.

To get started read the intro docs [NFTMakerPro Docs](https://docs.nft-maker.io/nft-maker-pro/introduction)

---

# Setup Prerequisite
First you need to [sign-up](https://docs.nft-maker.io/nft-maker-pro/using-nft-maker-pro) with NFTmakerpro account. This account will allow you to create a new project. After you create a project you will get a project id.

You will need few variables such a `api_key` & `nft_project_id` you can get these from the NFTmaker UI. `prefixName` is the prefix of your project name. This will be used to create the NFTs.


## Images Setup
Images and metadata should be added to the images folder, you can use the `folder_name` if you have more than one characters. In the example structre I only have one chracter `morpheus`

## Metadata Setup
Metadata files don't need to be full and rather only the placeholders you will provide based on the project policy you created.

---

# Uploading
In order to upload you will need to run `upload.py -h` to see the help messages.

```
‚ùØ python3 upload.py -f morpheus --ids 0501
INFO: Working on asset WoodCastleProject0501
```

# Delete
If you made mistakes and you want to deleting a token from the API you can do so with the `delete.py -h` script.

---

# Minting Token
On the day of mint you might want to mint some random tokens or minting specific tokens with token-ids, you can do that with the `mint.py -h` script.

You can also `mint.py` to mint random token for your team. you just need to add the `-r` flag.

```
# Mint specific item from the collection to default wallet.
# The number here comes from the NFTmaker pro database of tokens
python3 mint_specific.py -s 5568169

# Mint specific item from the collection to new wallet (for example if you want to mint/send directly to a team member)
python3 mint_specific.py -s 5568169 -w addr1q82qg32blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah

# Mint random token and send to default wallet
python3 mint_specific.py -r

# Mint random token and send to specific wallet
python3 mint_specific.py -r -w addr1q82qg32blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah
```
